#  Lost & Found AI Matching Service

AI-powered matching service for the Lost & Found application.

This service compares a user's **lost-item report** against registered **found-item reports** using multimodal embeddings. It combines information from the item's **image** and **text/title** to identify the most likely matches.


## Overview

The AI matching system receives information about a lost item and compares it with available found items.

The system uses both visual and textual information instead of relying only on one source.


# 🤖AI Model- SigLIP

The project uses:

```text
google/siglip-base-patch16-224
```

SigLIP is a multimodal vision-language model capable of representing both:

* Images
* Text

in a shared embedding space.

This allows the system to compare:

```text
Lost Item Image ↔ Found Item Image
```

and:

```text
Lost Item Title ↔ Found Item Title
```


# Matching Strategy

The system generates embeddings for both the lost item and found items.

### 1. Image similarity

The system converts the uploaded lost-item image into an image embedding.

Each found-item image is also converted into an image embedding.

Cosine similarity is then used to determine how visually similar the images are.

```text
Image Similarity
=
Cosine Similarity(
    Lost Image Embedding,
    Found Image Embedding
)
```


### 2. Text similarity

Convert the lost item's title into a text embedding.

For example:

```text
Silver HP Envy Laptop
```

Found-item titles can be compared against it:

```text
Black HP Envy Laptop
Silver HP Laptop
Gold HP Laptop
Maroon Backpack
```

The model calculates the semantic similarity between the titles.



### 3. Hybrid score

The final matching score combines image and text similarity.

Current weighting:

```text
Final Score =
    60% Image Similarity
    +
    40% Text Similarity
```

or:

```python
final_score = (
    0.6 * image_similarity
    +
    0.4 * text_similarity
)
```

This allows the system to consider both:

* What the item looks like
* What the user says the item is



# Example

Suppose a user reports:

```text
Lost Item:
Silver HP Envy Laptop
```

The system receives:

```text
Lost Image
+
"Silver HP Envy Laptop"
```

Possible found items:

| Found Item            | Image Similarity | Text Similarity | Final Score |
| --------------------- | ---------------: | --------------: | ----------: |
| Silver HP Envy Laptop |           0.8439 |          1.0000 |      0.9063 |
| Black HP Envy Laptop  |           0.7459 |          0.9596 |      0.8314 |
| Silver HP Laptop      |           0.7305 |          0.8981 |           — |
| Gold HP Laptop        |           0.6130 |          0.7838 |           — |
| Maroon Backpack       |           0.4617 |          0.5881 |           — |

The system ranks the most likely match first.

#  Installation

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd ai_service
```



## 2. Create a Conda environment

```bash
conda create -n ai python=3.11
```

Activate it:

```bash
conda activate ai
```


## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example dependencies:

```text
fastapi
uvicorn
torch
torchvision
transformers
pillow
numpy
python-dotenv
supabase
```


#  Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

Do not commit `.env` to GitHub.

Add it to `.gitignore`:

```text
.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

# Model Loading

The service uses:

```python
MODEL_NAME = "google/siglip-base-patch16-224"
```

The model is automatically downloaded from Hugging Face the first time it is loaded.

After downloading, the model can be reused locally.


# Embedding Generation

## Image embedding

The image is processed by SigLIP and converted into a vector representation.

Conceptually:

```text
Image
  ↓
SigLIP
  ↓
Image Embedding
  ↓
Normalization
```

## Text embedding

The item title is processed using the text side of SigLIP.

Example:

```text
"Silver HP Envy Laptop"
        ↓
      SigLIP
        ↓
 Text Embedding
```


#  Cosine Similarity

The system uses cosine similarity to compare embeddings.

Conceptually:

```text
Similarity(A, B)
=
(A · B)
/
(||A|| ||B||)
```

Higher values indicate greater similarity.

Example:

```text
0.90 → Very strong similarity
0.80 → Strong similarity
0.70 → Moderate similarity
0.50 → Weak similarity
```

These values should be treated as ranking scores rather than guaranteed probabilities.


#  Ranking

After calculating the hybrid score for each found item:

```text
Found Item A → 0.91
Found Item B → 0.83
Found Item C → 0.76
Found Item D → 0.62
Found Item E → 0.51
```

The system sorts the results in descending order:

```text
1. Found Item A
2. Found Item B
3. Found Item C
4. Found Item D
5. Found Item E
```

The application can display the top `K` matches to the user.
